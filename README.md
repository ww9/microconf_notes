## Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business – Jason Cohen, Founder, WP Engine – MicroConf 2013

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw
- Recurring Income is THE Objective
- $10k per founder per month
- Get 150 customers: 50 on linkedin, 25 guest post/social and 75 basic marketing
- 1 year plans are VERY important
- Offer 2 month discounts for 1 year plans
- ARPU: Average Revenue per User is the most important metric
- Double prices. Don't be afraid
- 3 to 4 tiers of plans. Highlight middle one. Make it bold. Most expensive should be called "Business"
- Don't do trials. Instead charge from day 1 and offer 60 days money back guarantees.
- B2b. Focus on business. Consumers pay little.
- Offer premium package for better SLAs. Premium users get support first in the queue.
- Avoid realtime stuff. When it breaks you need to fix ASAP.
- Pick something doable. Don't compete where great number of features are mandatory.
- Big markets: proven niches. There's space for everyone (CRM, PM, etc)
- Skip VC. They want you to grow to a billion $ bis and that will most likely kills it.
- Getting customers: Social media is bad, wastes to much time, not reproduceable.
- Successful companies just keep growing indefinitely. So hire support when necessary. But now you have to manage people. Maybe then you can sell the bis. Or raise prices to keep customer count low.
- Predictable acquisition of revenue with annual prepay in a good market creates a cash machine.
- Regrets not firing bad hires sooner.

## Lizards Thru Doorways: Proven Ways to Widen Your Funnel Using Just Your CTAs – Joanna Wiebe

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_urkVueszI
- CTA Buttons are VERY important. Don't label them "Subscribe now"
- Call to Action buttons should read something that solves the problem to the client like: "Show me how to easily manage my clinica"
- Buttons should suggest that their lives are going to get easier. Never suggest work.
- Headlines should only be responsible to keep the person on this page and nothing else. Make it simple
- Headline single job: keep them. Button has one job: get clicked.
- Steal headlines from customer input: Amazon Reviews, Testimonials
